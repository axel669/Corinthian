// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.

     *   high surrogates *and* uses surrogate pairs to match astral code points. The `bmp` and

     *
     * - Alphabetic
     *   Characters with the Alphabetic property. Generated from: Lowercase + Uppercase + Lt + Lm +
     *   Lo + Nl + Other_Alphabetic.
     *
     * - Default_Ignorable_Code_Point
     *   For programmatic determination of default ignorable code points. New characters that should
     *   be ignored in rendering (unless explicitly supported) will be assigned in these ranges,
     *   permitting programs to correctly handle the default rendering of such characters when not
     *   otherwise supported.
     *
     * - Lowercase
     *   Characters with the Lowercase property. Generated from: Ll + Other_Lowercase.
     *
     * - Noncharacter_Code_Point
     *   Code points permanently reserved for internal use.
     *
     * - Uppercase
     *   Characters with the Uppercase property. Generated from: Lu + Other_Uppercase.
     *
     * - White_Space
     *   Spaces, separator characters and other control characters which should be treated by
     *   programming languages as "white space" for the purpose of parsing elements.
     *
     * The properties ASCII, Any, and Assigned are also included but are not defined in UAX #44. UTS
     * #18 RL1.2 additionally requires support for Unicode scripts and general categories. These are
     * included in XRegExp's Unicode Categories and Unicode Scripts addons.

 * @param {Function} handler Function that returns a new pattern string (using native regex syntax)
 *   to replace the matched token within all future XRegExp regexes. Has access to persistent
 *   properties of the regex being built, through `this`. Invoked with three arguments:
 *   <li>The match array, with named backreference properties.
 *   <li>The regex scope where the match was found: 'default' or 'class'.
 *   <li>The flags used by the regex, including any flags in a leading mode modifier.
 *   The handler function becomes part of the XRegExp construction process, so be careful not to
 *   construct XRegExps within the function or you will trigger infinite recursion.
 * @param {Object} [options] Options object with optional properties:
 *   <li>`scope` {String} Scope where the token applies: 'default', 'class', or 'all'.
 *   <li>`flag` {String} Single-character flag that triggers the token. This also registers the
 *     flag, which prevents XRegExp from throwing an 'unknown flag' error when the flag is used.
 *   <li>`optionalFlags` {String} Any custom flags checked for within the token `handler` that are
 *     not required to trigger the token. This registers the flags, to prevent XRegExp from
 *     throwing an 'unknown flag' error when any of the flags are used.
 *   <li>`reparse` {Boolean} Whether the `handler` function's output should not be treated as
 *     final, and instead be reparseable by other tokens (including the current token). Allows
 *     token chaining or deferring.
 *   <li>`leadChar` {String} Single character that occurs at the beginning of any successful match
 *     of the token (not always applicable). This doesn't change the behavior of the token unless
 *     you provide an erroneous value. However, providing it can increase the token's performance
 *     since the token can be skipped at any positions where this character doesn't appear.
 * @example
 *
 * // Basic usage: Add \a for the ALERT control code
 * XRegExp.addToken(
 *   /\\a/,
 *   function() {return '\\x07';},
 *   {scope: 'all'}
 * );
 * XRegExp('\\a[\\a-\\n]+').test('\x07\n\x07'); // -> true
 *
 * // Add the U (ungreedy) flag from PCRE and RE2, which reverses greedy and lazy quantifiers.
 * // Since `scope` is not specified, it uses 'default' (i.e., transformations apply outside of
 * // character classes only)
 * XRegExp.addToken(
 *   /([?*+]|{\d+(?:,\d*)?})(\??)/,
 *   function(match) {return match[1] + (match[2] ? '' : '?');},
